#Java Side Project
This mobile application is a programming project that I have finished without any guides or tutorials walking me through; 
I created this application via Android Studio, using the programming language known as Java. 
This application tests for the users' internal clock. It is a fun exercise that shows an average of your cognition: reaction, perception, comprehension, and discernment.
This application is my second project. It taught me more of the code I was writing: the logical and mathematical side, whereas my first project taught me more about the user interface and graphics. 
This project allowed me to focus more on my Java files compared to my XML files.
This project was fun and engaging for me since it was about reaction time and critical thinking, a part of biology I find interesting.
